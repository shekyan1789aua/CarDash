# CarDash
The project is about the Car Usage of the user. The program gathers important data about the user's car and in the end determines the status of the car according to the power source, as the program also determines how much distance can the car drive. (or in which condition is the car when it comes to the power source). ( We will choose the one, after the group discussion).
